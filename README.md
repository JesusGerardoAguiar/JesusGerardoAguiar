Currently, I'm working with Serraform designing and developing a product for Decentraland. The product allows users to rent a m3u8 link with cryptocurrency in order to stream live streams, VOD, and Twitch/YouTube into Decentraland. This project has further expanded my skills in React and provided me with valuable experience in designing and developing new products.
